# Contact Form Testing Summary

## Test Results

✅ **Form Submission**: The contact form successfully submits data to the API endpoint.
✅ **UI Behavior**: The success message displays correctly after submission.
✅ **SMTP Configuration**: The email server configuration is properly set up in the code.
❓ **Email Delivery**: Potential issues with email delivery were identified.

## Email Delivery Issues

The most likely reasons for email delivery problems:

1. **Gmail Security Updates**: Gmail has deprecated "Less secure app access" and now requires App Passwords.
2. **SMTP Authentication**: The credentials in `.env.local` might be incorrect or outdated.
3. **Spam Filtering**: Emails might be delivered but landing in spam folders.
4. **Network Restrictions**: Server environment might be blocking outbound SMTP connections.

## Quick Fixes

1. **Update Gmail Credentials**:
   - Enable 2-Step Verification in your Google Account
   - Generate an App Password specifically for the website
   - Update the SMTP_PASSWORD in `.env.local`

2. **Switch to a Dedicated Email Service**:
   - Sign up for SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES
   - Update the SMTP configuration in `.env.local`
   - These services provide better deliverability and monitoring

3. **Enable Debug Mode**:
   - Set `DEBUG=true` in `.env.local`
   - Check server logs for detailed error messages

## Testing Tools

Three testing tools have been created in the `/test` directory:

1. `test-contact-form.js` - Tests the form submission process
2. `email-delivery-test.js` - Tests both form submission and email configuration
3. `test-email-sending.js` - Directly tests email sending functionality

Run these tools with `node` to diagnose specific issues:

```bash
cd test
npm install
node test-email-sending.js
```

See the [README.md](./README.md) in the test directory for detailed instructions.
