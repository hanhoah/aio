# Contact Form Functionality Test Report

## Summary
The contact form on aio-consulting.de has been tested using Playwright. The form submission process works correctly, and the API responds with a success message. However, potential issues with email delivery have been identified.

## Test Results

### Form Submission Test
- ✅ Form successfully submits data to the `/api/contact` endpoint
- ✅ API returns a 200 status code with appropriate success message
- ✅ Success message is displayed to the user after submission
- ✅ Form validation works as expected

### Email Delivery Configuration
- ✅ SMTP server configuration is present in `.env.local`
- ✅ SMTP host (smtp.gmail.com) DNS resolution is successful
- ✅ SMTP server connection test passed

## Potential Email Delivery Issues

Based on the codebase analysis and testing, here are potential reasons why emails might not be delivered:

1. **Gmail Security Settings**:
   - Gmail has deprecated "Less secure app access" and now requires App Passwords for SMTP
   - The current implementation uses Gmail's SMTP which requires specific authentication methods
   - Solution: Generate an App Password in the Google Account settings and use that in SMTP_PASSWORD

2. **SMTP Authentication**:
   - The SMTP credentials (SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASSWORD) might be incorrect or outdated
   - Solution: Verify that the credentials are correctly set in .env.local

3. **Email Spam Filtering**:
   - Emails might be delivered but landing in spam folders
   - Solution: Check spam folders and configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for better deliverability

4. **Nodemailer Configuration**:
   - The nodemailer configuration is using `secure: false` which is correct for port 587
   - TLS is required, which is configured correctly

5. **Server Environment**:
   - Firewalls or network restrictions might be blocking outbound SMTP connections
   - Solution: Ensure that the hosting environment allows outbound connections to SMTP servers

6. **Email Service Limits**:
   - Gmail has sending limits that might be exceeded
   - Solution: Consider using a dedicated email service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES

## Recommendations

1. **Switch to a Dedicated Email Service**:
   - Using services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES provides better deliverability and monitoring
   - These services provide APIs that are easier to integrate and more reliable than direct SMTP

2. **Add Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Enable the DEBUG mode in the .env.local file temporarily to get more detailed logs
   - Implement more comprehensive error logging for the email sending process

3. **Add Email Queue**:
   - Implement an email queue system to retry failed email deliveries
   - This can be done using a job queue system like Bull or simple setTimeout retries

4. **Implement Email Verification**:
   - Send a confirmation email to the site owner when a form is submitted
   - This helps identify if there are general email delivery issues

5. **Update the Nodemailer Configuration**:
   - Consider updating the Nodemailer configuration to use OAuth2 authentication for Gmail
   - This provides better security and reliability

## Conclusion

The contact form functionality works correctly from a user interface perspective. The API endpoint correctly processes the form data and returns appropriate responses. However, email delivery might be failing due to one or more of the issues identified above.

The most likely issue is related to Gmail's security settings and authentication methods. Switching to a dedicated email service provider would be the most reliable solution for ensuring email delivery.
